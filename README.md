# odin-recipes

This is a simple recipe website made purely of HTML.

The recipe pages contain images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and steps make the recipes.

In order to complete this project I needed to understand how to work with images, ordered and unordered lists, headings, links, and other basic HTML.

Additionally, I made an effort to commit my changes with clear, concise messages after each iteration in the assignment.
